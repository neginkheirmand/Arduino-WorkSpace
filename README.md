##A simple Arduino Workspace
I will be using the Arruino nano Atmega328P
All the code here and the info about the pinout available here is compatible with any type of Arduino nano and Arduino Uno. If you are using any other Arduino Board you should probabily change the pinout but the code will more likely be able to run on your board too.
