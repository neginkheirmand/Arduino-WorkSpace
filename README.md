## A simple Arduino Workspace
I will be using the Arruino nano Atmega328P
All the code here and the info about the pinout available  is compatible with any type of Arduino nano and Arduino Uno. If you are using any other Arduino Board you should probably  change the pinout but the code will more likely be able to run on your board too.

**Specifications:**

- Microcontroller: ATmega328
- Operating Voltage (logic level): 5V
- Input Voltage (recommended): 7-12V (5V if bypassing the onboard voltage regulator)
- Input Voltage (limits): 6-15V
- Digital I/O Pins: 14 (6 with pwm)
- Analog Inputs: 8
- DC Current per I/O Pin: 40ma (max of 200ma across all pins)
- Flash Memory: 32kb (2kb used by bootloader)
- SRAM: 2kb
- EEFROM: 1kb
- Clock Speed: 16mhz

**Documents:**

If you -like me- use the  ATmega328P CH340G Soldered based on Arduino Nano you'll need to use the CH340G drivers.
