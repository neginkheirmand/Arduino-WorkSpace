 Pin number 1 of the module is GND. You have to connect it to Arduino Ground.
 The next pin is Vcc. You have to connect it to the 3.3V output of the Arduino Uno. 
 Be careful! Do not connect it to 5V or you will destroy your module! The third pin is
 named CE and you can connect it to any digital pin you like. In this example
 I am going to connect it to digital pin 7. Pin 4 is CS and you can connect to any digital
 pin as well. I am going to connect to digital pin 8. The next pin is SCK which goes
 to digital pin 13 of the Arduino Uno. The next pin is MOSI which goes to digital pin 11 
 and the last pin in MISO which goes to digital pin 12.
