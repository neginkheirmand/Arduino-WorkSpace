The card has integrated 8192 bits EEPROM which is split into 16 sectors with 4 blocks. One block consist of 16 bytes.
the first blocks of the memory are reserved for manufacturer data like 32 bit serial number, these are read-only blocks. 

The MIFARE Classic 1K offers 1024 bytes of data storage, split into 16 sectors; each
sector is protected by two different keys, called A and B. Each key can be
programmed to allow operations such as reading, writing, increasing valueblocks,
etc.

notes(in the code)
	PCD:  Proximity Coupling Reader( Reader Module- the rfid card reader-)
	PICC: Proximity Integrated Cricuit Chip(Card Target)`

	functions:
		.PICC_HaltA()  end communication with the card
