 Pin number 1 of the module is GND. You have to connect it to Arduino Ground.
 The next pin is Vcc. You have to connect it to the 3.3V output of the Arduino Uno. 
 Be careful! Do not connect it to 5V or you will destroy your module! The third pin is
 named CE and you can connect it to any digital pin you like. In this example
 I am going to connect it to digital pin D7. Pin 4 is CS and you can connect to any digital
 pin as well. I am going to connect to digital pin D8. The next pin is SCK which goes
 to digital pin D13 of the Arduino Uno/Nano. The next pin is MOSI which goes to digital pin 11 
 and the last pin in MISO which goes to digital pin 12.


Warning:
you have to connect it to the 3.3v of the arduino
do not connect it to 5v
